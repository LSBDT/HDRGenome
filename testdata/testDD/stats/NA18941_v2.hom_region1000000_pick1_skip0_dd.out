Statdel: Auto generated parameter file
P-values include observed data.
Variant-specific (primary) statistic (ONE-SIDED):
 t statistic, unequal variances (code = -12)
Threshold for min. median HDR = 0.5000. 10 May 2021 13:39:46h

=== Datafile 1, /var/folders/12/f5vg17pn5c76pg7wccd147kw0000gp/T/6tznNY7USc ===
Number of candidate/valid ROHs = 2/1. Number of pairs: 3 case-ctrl (Gr.1), 3 others (Gr.2), 6 total
Of 2 ROHs, 1 have avg#variants < 3.0. Total of 0 missing pairs found

EXPLANATIONS TO TABLE BELOW
"n" indicates the number of heterozygous variants flanking an ROH, and
 number of input files holding HDR values
TestStat=-9.0 indicates no valid test statistic available
"Line" indicates the line number of the given ROH in the n-th input file
mH=low means that the median HDR of case-control pairs is less than
 stated threshold, mH=ok otherwise.
